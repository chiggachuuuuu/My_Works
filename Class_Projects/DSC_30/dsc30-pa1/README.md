# DSC 30 — PA1

> Java warm-up: basic I/O, simple utilities, and programming challenges with a small test harness.

## Overview
This PA introduces the Java toolchain and basic programming patterns. It includes a simple “Hello, World!” program, a one-hot utility, and a set of small challenges with a companion test runner.

## Folder Contents
- `src/`
  - `HelloWorld.java` — minimal console output program
  - `Main.java` — entry point to run selected demos/utilities
  - `OneHot.java` — helper for one-hot style operations (see comments in file)
  - `ProgrammingChallenges.java` — solutions to PA1 mini-problems
  - `ProgrammingChallengesTest.java` — lightweight tests / sanity checks
- `PA1.iml` — IDE metadata (IntelliJ/IDEA)

> If your filenames differ slightly in your repo, prefer those names.
