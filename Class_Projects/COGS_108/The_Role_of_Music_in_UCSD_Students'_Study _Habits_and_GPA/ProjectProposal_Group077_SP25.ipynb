    "Music is an integral part of daily life for many college students, including those at UCSD. However, its impact on academic performance measured in our study strictly as self reported GPA remains contested in scientific literature. Prior research suggests that music can influence several cognitive functions directly tied to academic success, such as attention, working memory, and arousal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, arousal theory posits that optimal levels of stimulation, such as soft background music, can heighten alertness and mental performance <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Conversely, dual-task interference theory warns that music, especially with lyrics, may overload the brain’s limited processing capacity, disrupting tasks that require high cognitive effort <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Working memory, which is essential for tasks like reading comprehension and problem-solving, is especially vulnerable to such distractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some studies indicate that instrumental music may enhance study focus and productivity <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), while lyrical or high-tempo genres may impair concentration and lower performance on memory based tasks <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). Despite these findings, there remains limited research examining how the context of music listening specifically whether it occurs during study sessions versus leisure time affects academic outcomes. Additionally, few studies have focused on UCSD students or considered daily lifestyle variables that may confound these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study aims to fill this gap. We define academic performance strictly as GPA to ensure clarity and consistency. We also account for potential confounds including academic major, weekly study hours, and sleep quality, all of which can influence GPA independently <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Through a structured survey, we will quantify both the type of music (instrumental vs. lyrical) and the context (studying vs. relaxing), to assess how these factors correlate with GPA among UCSD students.\n",

Questions are phrased neutrally ( “Which genres do you listen to while studying?” rather than “Does your preferred genre improve your GPA?”) to avoid leading responses.\n",

During analysis, we will examine whether specific majors, years, or colleges are over or underrepresented.\n",
